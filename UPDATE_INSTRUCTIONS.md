# How to Update Your SpecificVenueCard Component

## Important Note: Local-Only Rating System

⚠️ **API Limitation**: The Holidaze API does not provide endpoints for user rating submissions. This rating system is implemented using localStorage as a demonstration of what rating functionality could look like if the API supported it.

## 1. Import the new VenueRatingDisplay component

Add this import at the top of your `SpecificVenueCard.jsx` file:

```jsx
import VenueRatingDisplay from '../../components/VenueRatingDisplay.jsx';
```

## 2. Replace the current rating line

Find this line in your component:
```jsx
<p className="text-grey-600 mb-4">{venue.rating === 0 ? 'No ratings' : `${venue.rating} ★`}</p>
```

Replace it with:
```jsx
<VenueRatingDisplay venue={venue} className="mb-4" />
```

## 3. The new component will show:
- ✅ **Venue's original rating** (from the API)
- ✅ **Your personal rating** (stored locally - localStorage only)
- ✅ **Average rating** (if both exist)
- ✅ **Date when you rated it**

## 4. Similarly, update your MyBookingsCard component

In `MyBookingsCard.jsx`, you can add the rating display near the venue name:

```jsx
<Link to={`/venues/${venue.id}`}>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">{booking.venue.name}</h3>
</Link>
<VenueRatingDisplay venue={venue} className="mb-2" />
```

Don't forget to import it:
```jsx
import VenueRatingDisplay from '../../components/VenueRatingDisplay.jsx';
```

## 5. Benefits:
- ✅ **Demonstrates rating functionality** even with API limitations
- ✅ **Maintains venue's original rating** from the API
- ✅ **Shows your personal ratings** stored locally
- ✅ **Clear distinction** between API rating vs personal rating
- ✅ **Properly documented** as local-only due to API constraints

## 6. Technical Note:
This implementation serves as a proof-of-concept. In a real-world scenario where the API supported user ratings, the same UI components could be used with actual API endpoints instead of localStorage.
